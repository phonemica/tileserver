# tileserver
Express.js based tile server for .mbtiles

This began as a fork of `TheGartrellGroup/mbtiles-server` which is in turn a fork of the much older [`chelm/mbtiles-server`](https://github.com/chelm/mbtiles-server), with all the extra stuff stripped out. The original repo is unmaintained, and the fork had much more than what we need.

It is a basic tile server for testing purposes on small-scale Phonemica projects. `chelm/mbtiles-server` is no longer maintained so we're maintaining our own version here that we can keep up to date but also as simple as possible to run through `pm2`.
